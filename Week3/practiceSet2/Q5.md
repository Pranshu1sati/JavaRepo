What is the order of Constructor execution for the following

### Inheritance Hierarchy:

Base
|
Derived1
|
Derived2

Derived2 obj = new Derived2();
Which Constructor(s) will be executed and what is their order?

### Ans:

### Constructor Execution:

When creating an instance of `Derived2` with the statement `Derived2 obj = new Derived2();`, the constructors that will be executed and their order depend on the use of the `super` keyword in the constructors of `Derived1` and `Derived2`.

- **Without `super` Keyword:** If we are not using the `super` keyword, then it will only run the constructor of the `Derived2` class.

- **With `super` Keyword:** If we have used `super` while defining the constructors of the `Derived1` and `Derived2` classes, then all three constructors will be invoked in the following order:
  1. `Base`
  2. `Derived1`
  3. `Derived2`

If we are not using super keyword, then it will only run the constructor of Derived2 class
Otherwise, if we have used super while defining the constructors of the classes Derived1 and Derived2 then all the
three Constructors will be invoked in the order -> Base, Derived1 and Derived2
